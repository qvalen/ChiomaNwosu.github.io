									<p>My journey into the field of data analytics has been unconventional yet profoundly enriching. With a foundation in psychology, my academic and professional experiences have been centered around understanding human behavior and cognitive processes. This background has equipped me with a unique perspective in data analysisâ€”especially in areas involving user experience and behavior analytics. The transition from psychology to data analytics was driven by my fascination with data's power to influence and improve decisions and outcomes. Learning to harness this power has enabled me to blend analytical rigor with psychological insights, enhancing both the depth and breadth of my projects. My research in psychology, showcases my approach to rigorous data collection, analysis, and the derivation of meaningful insights. These projects are illustrative of the skills and methodologies that I have brought into my data analytics career, emphasizing my commitment to evidence-based conclusions and strategic thinking. If you are interested in exploring some of my research work further, please feel free to view the details.
